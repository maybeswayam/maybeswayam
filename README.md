# 👋 Hey, I'm Swayam

### 🚀 Aspiring ML Engineer | Backend Developer | Always Building

I'm a B.Tech student who loves turning ideas into working projects. I enjoy ML, backend engineering, and deploying real-world apps — even when the deployment fights back.

## 🧠 What I Work On

* **Machine Learning & AI**: Building models that *actually* work, not just look good on paper.
* **Deep Learning**: LSTM-based NLP models, PyTorch/TensorFlow experiments, and hands-on model training.
* **Full‑Stack Projects**: Creating end‑to‑end systems — from training ML models to deploying them.
* **Cloud & Deployment**: Docker, AWS EC2, GitHub Actions… basically battling the cloud until it submits.
* **Firebase**: Currently using it to build a real-time attendance tracking system.
* **Audio ML Projects**: Working on a small-scale Shazam-like model to identify songs from audio snippets.

## 📌 Projects I'm Working On

### 🔬 Histopathology ML System

A full ML pipeline + backend + frontend setup for histopathology image analysis.

* Model training (CNNs / DL models)
* FastAPI backend
* Deployment with Docker + AWS

### 🎵 Mini‑Shazam (Song Recognition Model)

An ML project that listens to a short audio snippet and predicts which song it is from a dataset of ~100 songs.

* MFCC feature extraction
* Neural networks for classification
* Training + evaluation on Google Colab

### 📲 Attendance System (Firebase)

A clean, fast, and straightforward attendance tracking project using Firebase for real-time databases and auth.
